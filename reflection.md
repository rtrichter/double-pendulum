# Week 2 of weekly project things

I spent a lot of time on my SoftDev and Physics exams, plus homework, plus music, plus robotics, ...  
Overall I'm happy with the pendulum that I was able to make in just an hour or so   

The double pendulum as it would turn out has some really hard math involved that I was stubborn
    and wanted to do myself. Implementing it using the equations online feels dissatisfying so 
    I am choosing to stop now so i can go back to this some day when I have more time and am
    maybe a little smarter and I can feel the satisfaction of doing it myself.

I technically still have tomorrow to work on this but I don't have the resources (knowledge) that 
    I need to do this in the next day. My roommate has covid so I'm spending as much time out of the room
    as I can which means lots of time in study spaces. I'm hoping to use time tomorrow to work on either
    robotics or next weeks project instead.
